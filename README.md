# Rebuilding my developer profile Comming soon : Sept/Oct 2024

## Deploying to gh pages
I have a package which automates publishing to ghpages - just push changes to github 'main', then run 'npm run deploy' in 'main' branch and it will auto update the gh-page branch which has build for deployment



## Git commit codeNames



fix: Use this when you’re addressing a bug or an issue in the code. For example, fix: resolve crash on login screen. 

update: This is typically used for non-breaking changes that improve or modify existing functionality. For example, update: enhance user profile layout. 

feat: Use this when you’re adding a new feature. For example, feat: add user authentication. 

refactor: Use this when you’re restructuring code without changing its external behavior. For example, refactor: optimize database queries. 

style: Use this for changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.). For example, style: fix indentation in main.css. 

chore: Use this for changes that do not modify src or test files. For example, chore: update dependencies. 

docs: Use this for documentation changes. For example, docs: update README with setup instructions. 





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
